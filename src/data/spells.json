The creature must not have died for longer than 30 days and should have enough body parts to live when brought back to life. Revival has a risk of failure. To bring a creature back from death, you need to roll 2d6, against the creature’s Destiny’s End Points and match or beat the number. Successful revival will increase the creature’s Destiny’s End Points by 4. Failure to revive the creature will sever its souls and spirits from its body forever and it can no longer be revived. See the Revival And Destiny’s End section of this chapter for more details."
